# iota-dashboard

A meteor based dashboard website for monitoring the IOTA network, includes a d3 realtime visualiser of the IOTA Tangle, and a stats page for monitoring the health and metrics of the network.

To use you need a full IOTA node running with an --export flag and point the chokidar path watcher in server.js to that directory.
